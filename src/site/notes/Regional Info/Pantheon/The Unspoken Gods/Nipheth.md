### **God of Undead and Void 

---
#### **Description**
Nipheth is portrayed as a tall, skeletal figure wrapped in heavy robes that fall in rigid, straight lines, as if unaffected by movement or wind. Artists describe the body as thin to the point of abstraction, the limbs more like suggestions of bone outlined beneath fabric. The face ranges from expressionless skull-like masks to hollow visages with smooth surfaces where features should be. Eyes are commonly shown as dim, recessed points or shallow depressions that reflect no light. Clothing is adorned with symbols representing thresholds or empty frames, patterns repeating in stark geometry. His posture is typically upright, rigid, and still, conveying presence through absence rather than form.

Cult records speak of a pale, faceless bird associated with him. Wings glide silently, and its passing is marked only by a faint distortion of light or a brief flicker of darkness.

#### **Personality**
Forbidden texts portray Nipheth as the unyielding sentinel of the threshold, a figure who governs the stillness between endings and what lies beyond. Writings present him as austere, precise, and entirely detached from mortal concerns, acting according to laws unknown but consistent. Devotees interpret his role as maintaining the quiet boundary where life ceases and vacancy takes hold.

Testimonies from those claiming contact vary sharply. Some describe the impression of vast emptiness pressing close, not hostile but entirely indifferent. Others recall a muted awareness of being studied by something distant, as though perceived from a great remove. A few recount momentary glimpses of stark clarity that vanish as soon as they form. These recollections offer no agreement on demeanor, conveying only that his attention reflects a perspective untouched by the concerns of the living.

#### **Domain**
Nipheth’s influence governs undeath, stillness, and the quiet void that lies between endings. His followers invoke him when seeking to preserve what should have passed, to pierce the barrier between life and death, or to draw upon the emptiness that fills abandoned places. His presence is noted when silence deepens unnaturally, when remains linger untouched by time, or when vitality drains without visible wound.

Miracles attributed to Nipheth emerge without spectacle. One account tells of a fallen warrior whose body did not decay despite the march of seasons, lying as untouched as polished stone. Another describes a necromancer whose failing spell stabilized when a cold hush filled the room, allowing the ritual to proceed with impossible precision. These occurrences are read as the world pausing—in part or in whole—beneath his influence.
