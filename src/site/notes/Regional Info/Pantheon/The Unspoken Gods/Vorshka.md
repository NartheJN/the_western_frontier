### **Goddess of Disease and Rot 

---
#### **Description**
Vorshka appears in forbidden artwork as a withered, thin figure draped in layered fabrics that cling unevenly to the body, revealing warped proportions beneath. Artists often sketch the form with elongated fingers, joints slightly swollen, and skin shaded in mottled patches that blend into the surrounding environment. Her face is narrow, with hollowed contours and eyes depicted as dull, sunken orbs, often framed by fragile strands of hair that hang in clumped, uneven locks. Garments bear embroidered patterns reminiscent of spreading veins or fungal blooms, their shapes branching outward across the cloth. Her posture is bent or hunched, though always in a way that suggests patient observation rather than weakness.

Accounts mention a small, many-eyed carrion creature that follows her—a lopsided thing that scurries into dark places and leaves behind faint trails of dried residue shaped like branching sigils.

#### **Personality**
Obscure scripture speaks of Vorshka as the patient steward of decline, depicted as one who guides the inevitable processes of breaking down what can no longer endure. Teachings emphasize her role in revealing underlying weakness and reminding mortals of the limits of resilience. Her few devoted interpreters describe her as quiet, methodical, and unhurried in purpose.

Accounts from self-proclaimed witnesses complicate this reserved portrayal. Some describe a sense of gradual dimming, as though vigor were receding from the edges inward. Others speak of a watchfulness that emerges only in stillness, producing a faint awareness of being examined by something slow and persistent. A few mention brief impressions of creeping change spreading through their surroundings, subtle yet unmistakable. These visions lack consistency, revealing only that her presence aligns with the onset of slow transformation.

#### **Domain**
Vorshka’s influence governs decay, sickness, and the quiet processes that break down what has outlived resilience. Her followers seek her favor when uncovering hidden weaknesses, hastening an inevitable end, or understanding how corruption spreads. Signs of her presence appear when structures rot faster than expected, when frailty reveals itself suddenly, or when stagnant places seem to sink deeper into decline.

Miracles attributed to Vorshka tend to unfold slowly. One tale describes a tyrant’s sealed grain stores spoiling overnight, the rot spreading in precise patterns as though guided by invisible lines. Another recounts a healer who watched an incurable infection recede from a patient it had clung to for years, not as restoration but as an abrupt cessation of its progress. Such events suggest her influence moves along the fine boundary between dissolution and release.
