The Unspoken Gods are deities whose presence haunts the edges of mortal understanding, governing forces that are feared, corrupting, or inscrutable. Mortals rarely encounter them directly, and knowledge of their existence comes through fragmentary accounts, whispers, or the subtle, unsettling effects they leave on the world. Their presence is noted more in whispers, cautionary tales, or in the shadows cast across mortal experience; governing forces that mortals struggle to understand or endure.

Accounts of these gods are fragmented and often contradictory. Some describe fleeting glimpses of impossible shapes, chilling sensations, or inexplicable misfortune, which later become the basis of legend or moral teaching. Others claim to receive quiet messages or dreams warning of their approach, though interpretation varies with the observer.

Their relationships with mortals are often framed as predatory, manipulative, or inscrutable. Mortals may experience subtle temptation, unseen interference, or corrupting influence, which can appear as chance, coincidence, or personal failing. In some traditions, mortals who attract the attention of these gods are considered marked, though whether this is blessing, curse, or merely the natural consequence of exposure remains a matter of debate.

Even without open temples or scripture, these gods exert influence, a quiet force shaping destiny and misfortune alike, reminding mortals that some powers are felt rather than understood. Despite fear or avoidance, some mortal sects attempt veneration or appeasement, offering rituals, prayers, or protective charms. Scholars note that even the smallest sign of acknowledgment seems to draw attention, though what the gods themselves desire, or whether they notice at all, remains beyond comprehension.
