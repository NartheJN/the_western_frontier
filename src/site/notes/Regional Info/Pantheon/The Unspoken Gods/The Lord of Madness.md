#### **Description**
Depictions of the Lord of Madness are inconsistent to the point of incoherence, yet certain motifs recur across pieces made by those who survived long enough to finish their work. Most portray a humanoid silhouette fragmented into overlapping shapes—limbs drawn in multiple positions at once, heads stacked or mirrored, or torsos split into spiraling patterns. The face is rarely more than a cluster of asymmetrical marks, some resembling eyes placed at random angles. Colors and lines clash violently, creating visual depth that seems to shift upon further viewing. Clothing is rendered as spirals, loops, or twisted latticework that refuse stable interpretation. Posture varies wildly from piece to piece, though many suggest an unnerving sense of inward folding or outward unraveling.

Whispers mention a small creature associated with this being, though descriptions differ: sometimes insectoid, sometimes many-mouthed, sometimes a shape that cannot be fully remembered. Survivors note only that it leaves behind looping, jagged symbols trailing across surfaces, drawn with no apparent pattern.

#### **Personality**
The sparse doctrine that survives portrays the Lord of Madness as the embodiment of unpatterned thought, not as a being of cruelty but as the dissolution of structure from which new possibilities emerge. Fragmented hymns describe this god as boundaryless, unconcerned with coherence, operating beyond all frameworks mortals use to define meaning. Cult interpreters speak of him not as malicious but as entirely untethered.

Experiences reported by vision-bearers diverge wildly. Some describe intrusive flashes of comprehension that break apart before coalescing. Others speak of a shifting awareness nearby, its attention flickering unpredictably. A few recount sequences of impressions that defy order, leaving only a lingering sense that something had been perceived without clarity. These accounts resist categorization, revealing only that his influence moves without pattern or intention that mortals can trace.

#### **Domain**
The Lord of Madness governs fractured insight, unraveling thought, and the spaces where logic loosens its grip. Devotees turn to him when seeking forbidden revelation, when creativity emerges through disordered thinking, or when reality’s coherence thins. Signs of his presence appear in sudden flashes of impossible understanding, in patterns forming where no reason supports them, or in conversations that drift into truths unmeant.

Miracles aligned with him seldom appear consistent. One story tells of a scribe who solved a centuries-old cipher after hearing a meaningless rhythm tapped by an unseen hand. Another speaks of a cultist trapped in a labyrinth who escaped only because the walls briefly aligned in ways that made no architectural sense. Such events are understood as distortions that grant fleeting clarity through disorder.
