### Lord of Justice and Nobility

---
#### **Description**
Many cultures shape Bahamut in artwork as a colossal dragon forged from pale metal, each scale rendered like hammered silver catching the faintest glimmer of light. Painters favor elongated wings that arc upward like protective walls, while sculptors carve the jawline with restrained strength rather than savage force. His eyes are commonly shown as soft luminescent orbs, symbols of judgment delivered with distance rather than wrath. Bards describe a voice imagined as a low tremor in the chest, steady and measured, as though the world itself speaks in his stead.

Testimonies from those claiming encounters depict something far less solid. Some recall a drifting shimmer, as if a dragon-shaped reflection moved across the air without a source. Others speak of a pressure behind the sternum, followed by the outline of wings forming from pale brilliance. A few mention seeing a long, serpentine silhouette coiling through sky or cloud, though none agree on size or clarity. All accounts share a sense of order settling into place before the presence fades.

The echo attributed to Bahamut often appears as a silver-limned feather falling in still air, said to manifest only when justice is restored or mercy has narrowly prevailed.

#### **Personality**
Scripture presents the Platinum Dragon as an unwavering arbiter of restraint and righteous structure, depicted as a force that favours deliberation over impulse. Teachings describe him as measured in all judgments, a presence that guides order through steadiness rather than intimidation. Clerics speak of his lawfulness within goodness, authority delivered through balance, with mercy offered only when discipline is preserved.

Accounts from those claiming visions complicate this portrayal. Some describe a cool clarity settling across their thoughts, as if their intentions were silently sorted into proper alignment. Others recount a vast presence observing without approval or condemnation, a sensation of being weighed against an unseen standard. A few mention a flicker of pale radiance that presses forward when harm is imminent, offering neither comfort nor threat, only direction. The impressions rarely align, revealing only that his principles sit beyond mortal assumptions of justice.

#### **Domain**
Order defines Bahamut’s sphere, shaping law, measured judgment, and the calibrated use of strength. Followers call upon him to restore structure, settle disputes, or reinforce discipline in moments where clarity falters. His influence is credited when chaos yields to method, or when individuals act with restraint in situations prone to escalation.

Events attributed to Bahamut often surface as subtle corrections rather than dramatic intervention. Some recount a quarrel that abruptly lost its momentum, as though unspoken logic drew the participants back into alignment. Others describe a battlefield moment where scattered forces shifted into unplanned formation, their movements suddenly coordinated despite no clear command. Tales also mention records long thought corrupted arranging themselves into proper sequence, the resolution arriving without visible cause. These occurrences are understood as nudges toward stability, reinforcing order without overt display.
