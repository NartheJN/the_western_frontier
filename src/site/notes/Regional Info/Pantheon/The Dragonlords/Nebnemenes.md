### Lord of Balance and Order

---
#### **Description**
Many cultures portray Nebnemenes as a vast dragon shaped from gradations of grey so precise they seem crafted rather than grown. Artists favor scales rendered like smooth stone at dusk, neither bright nor dark, giving the impression of a creature suspended between states. Wings are usually depicted in perfect symmetry, each membrane stretched in mirrored tension, while the head is sculpted with measured, expressionless calm. His eyes are often shown as muted, reflective spheres that reveal nothing, symbols of judgment untouched by passion or disdain. Storytellers describe his imagined voice as a quiet vibration through the bones, level and unfaltering, more like a line being drawn than a sound being spoken.

Testimonies from those claiming true encounters describe far less definition. Some recount a balanced shape appearing in the periphery, an outline resolving only long enough to be recognized before dissipating into even light. Others mention the sensation of opposing forces equalizing around them, followed by the faint suggestion of wings forming in perfect alignment. A few report glimpsing a shifting silhouette of a dragon whose edges blur into flawless symmetry, though none agree on whether it was solid, spectral, or merely an impression. What aligns these accounts is the sense of tension leveling out, as though a scale had settled into its rightful center.

The echo attributed to Nebnemenes is said to appear as a perfectly smooth grey stone resting where imbalance has been corrected, a token that marks not victory or loss but the restoration of equilibrium.

#### **Personality**
Scripture frames Nebnemenes as the custodian of equilibrium, a guardian whose purpose lies in preventing any force, moral, arcane, or draconic, from straying beyond its proper influence. Teachings emphasize his detachment, describing a will that favours correction over intervention and regard for outcomes only insofar as they preserve balance. His adherents speak of him as impartial to conflict, engaging only when symmetry fractures.

Claims of direct experience offer a colder, quieter image. Some describe a moment of internal leveling, as if opposing impulses were pressed into alignment without force. Others mention a presence that observes only the deviation in a situation rather than the individuals within it. A few recount a muted silhouette forming at the edge of perception when imbalance grows severe, its attention fixed not on the observer but on the disruption itself. Reports hold little consistency, except in the sense that whatever consciousness touched them cared only for restoring a midpoint, not for the motives surrounding it.

#### **Domain**
Balance anchors Nebnemenes’ domain, encompassing symmetry, correction, and the neutral point between competing forces. Devotees seek his guidance when systems tilt too far toward destruction or excess, invoking him to level outcomes or return unstable situations to their natural center. His touch is credited when extremes soften or when conflicting powers settle into quiet standoff.

Manifestations attributed to Nebnemenes take the form of adjustments rather than blessings. Some tales describe a magical surge that abruptly stabilized, its uncontrolled intensity dropping into measured flow as though recalibrated mid-casting. Others recount feuding factions whose conflict drained of momentum, with neither side finding advantage despite shifting tactics. A rare account mentions a landscape altered by violent magic gradually smoothing into undisturbed terrain, the scars fading without intervention. Such events are framed as corrections applied with precision, restoring equilibrium where it has slipped.

> **1. Maintain equilibrium in all dealings.**  
> Where extremes rise, act to soften them; where absence reigns, supply presence. Let neither excess nor void claim full dominion.

> Reject choices that elevate one force far above its counterpart, whether in emotion, influence, or consequence.
> 
> **3. Stand apart from the pull of alignment.**  
> Do not bind yourself wholly to light or shadow; walk the center with clarity, preserving neutrality even when others demand allegiance.
