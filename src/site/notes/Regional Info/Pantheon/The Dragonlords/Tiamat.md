### Lord of Greed and Vengeance

---
#### **Description**
Iconography portrays Tiamat as a many-headed wyrm rising from fractured stone, each neck twisting at a different angle as if the body strains against itself. Artists vary widely in color and detail, but the five heads are constant: open jaws, uneven horns, and eyes painted with stark, predatory brightness. Stories describe scales rendered like shards of volcanic glass or lacquered enamel that catches only harsh reflections. Depictions lean toward excess—too many teeth, too many ridges—as if accuracy matters less than evoking dread.

Witness reports mirror this inconsistency. Some describe only a single head emerging from darkness before splitting into several like branches of lightning. Others claim the presence is sensed before seen, marked by a sudden tightening of the world and a prickling along the spine. A handful insist they saw a heaving mass of wings and talons too large to belong to one creature. None agree whether her forms are glimpses of truth or illusions meant to overwhelm perception.

Her echo is spoken of as a five-pointed shadow cast where no light falls, often appearing at moments of treachery or unrestrained ambition.

#### **Personality**
Scripture from hidden cults depicts Tiamat as a force of ambition manifested through many minds at once, emphasizing her talent for exploiting tension and her delight in testing the limits of dominance. Texts paint her as patient yet opportunistic, a strategist who values hunger for power as proof of vitality. Followers whisper of her as both tutor and tyrant, sharpening devotion through challenge rather than affection.

Vision-bearers describe a presence that fragments across sensation, five pressures circling thought, each with its own intent. Some speak of a shifting authority that coils around choices, nudging them toward excess without overt command. Others recall a sudden stillness before an internal surge, as if multiple wills briefly agreed on a single directive. Rare accounts mention a flare of chromatic brilliance that refuses to settle into one meaning. The experiences diverge, unified only by the impression of competing impulses moving with deliberate coordination.

#### **Domain**
Ambition shapes Tiamat’s domain, governing dominance, cunning strategy, and the pursuit of influence through layered intent. Her adherents invoke her when seeking leverage, expanding power, or navigating conflicts where advantage must be carved from shifting circumstances. Many ascribe sudden insight in negotiation or unexpected opportunity during rivalry to her notice.

Signs of her influence tend to manifest through coinciding turns of circumstance. One story tells of a merchant who discovered a rival’s hidden weakness at the exact moment a deal hinged upon it, the revelation arriving without clear source. Another describes a commander whose faltering plan realigned when enemy forces fractured under internal dispute, the timing conspicuously precise. Some accounts mention objects vanishing from one place and reappearing where they best served her follower’s ascent. These events are interpreted as quiet manipulations, steering ambition through well-placed imbalance.
