The Dragonlords are ancient, tangible beings whose existence predates most memory, regarded as the forebears of dragonkind. Unlike the Prime Deities, their presence is concrete rather than abstract, though they rarely interact with the material plane today. Mortals rarely perceive them directly; understanding comes through legend, heraldic symbols, visions, and the subtle imprint of their will on dragon society and the natural world. Each Dragonlord represents a fundamental aspect of draconic existence: justice and honour, balance and order, or greed and vengeance.

Mortal history describes them in sweeping, awe-filled terms: shining scales that reflect ideals, many-headed forms that signal ambition, or colossal figures that embody equilibrium. These portrayals are drawn from a combination of mortal scripture, oral tradition, and heroic tales from the ages when dragons walked the world openly. Stories have been retold, altered, forgotten, and reshaped over generations, leaving mortal understanding both vivid and inconsistent.

Their influence is indirect, primarily expressed through the behaviour of dragons who inherit their principles or ambitions. Mortal orders, knights, and scholars venerate them as exemplars of aspiration, morality, or cautionary tales, while some are drawn to a path of greed, vengeance, and domination, forming secretive or corrupt cults that imitate cruelty and ambition. Miracles attributed to these beings are rare, usually observed through the acts of dragons themselves rather than as direct intervention.

Among themselves, the Dragonlords are described as titanic, ageless, and formidable, embodying the extremes of draconic nature. For mortals, they exist primarily as stories, sources of awe, and the distant echoes of a time when dragons shaped the world openly. The Dragonlords remind those who study them that even beings of immense power operate through patterns and principles, rather than overt governance.
