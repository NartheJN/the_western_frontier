### God of Life and the Sun

---
#### **Description**
In stories and scripture, Ramor is imagined as a radiant figure, humanoid in form, with features softened by golden light. His skin is depicted in layered shades of sunlit stone, shifting from pale gold to deep amber. Eyes are often painted as pale discs, wide and luminous, conveying clarity and warmth rather than literal sight. Artists show him with high, strong cheekbones, a straight nose, and lips curved in calm authority. Hair flows like threads of morning light, drifting and rippling as if stirred by invisible currents. He is frequently depicted in flowing robes of gold and white, sometimes edged with motifs of rays or sunbursts, standing tall and upright, radiating a sense of steady guardianship.

Stories speak of the Solar Stag as Ramor’s herald, a towering deer crowned with antlers that glow molten-gold even in shadowed woods. Its coat is said to shift with the sun’s progress, from pale dawn-gold to deep amber at dusk, bathing fields and glades in gentle illumination. Poets describe its gaze as steady and inspiring, a presence that emboldens life itself.

#### **Personality**
Scripture presents Ramor as the steadfast guardian of life’s cycles, depicted with the authority of a patient father and the constancy of the rising sun. Teachings emphasize his reliability, his nurturing intent, and his unwavering vigilance against threats to vitality. Clergy describe him as warm in judgment and firm in expectation, a figure who guides rather than compels.

Personal accounts from those claiming visions complicate this image. Some speak of an enveloping warmth that feels reassuring yet impersonal, like standing near a hearth too large to comprehend. Others describe the impression of watchful scrutiny, a calm presence weighing outcomes without revealing preference. A few recount flashes of fierce radiance that appear in moments of danger, hinting at a sharper aspect often softened in doctrine. These glimpses lack agreement on his temperament, revealing only that his guidance carries purpose beyond the interpretations mortals place upon it.

---
#### **Domain**
Ramor’s influence governs life, vitality, and the steady cycle of daylight. Followers invoke him to restore health, nurture growth, or strengthen the natural order. His presence is credited when crops flourish unexpectedly, wounds mend beyond expectation, or communities survive sudden disaster.

Miracles attributed to Ramor often appear as subtle shifts in the world rather than overt displays. One story tells of a traveler whose injuries faded as sunlight pooled unnaturally around them, the body returning to its previous state without direct intervention. Another recounts a village where creeping blight halted at the edge of a sunbeam, as though the light itself resisted corruption. These events are understood as guidance and protection, emphasizing renewal and the preservation of life rather than sheer force.

Sees mortals as children under his watch, fragile yet capable of growth. He offers guidance and protection, rarely intervening directly, preferring the cycles of life to unfold with subtle influence. Devotion is rewarded with signs of renewal or vitality, but judgment is implicit: life must be nurtured responsibly.
