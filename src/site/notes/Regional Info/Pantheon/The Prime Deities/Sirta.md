### **Goddess of Knowledge and Secrets**

---
#### **Description**
Sirta is imagined as composed and precise, with a face that conveys careful thought and quiet authority. Artists often depict her with high, pale cheekbones, thin lips pressed in subtle concentration, and narrow, reflective eyes that seem to pierce through illusion. Hair is usually long and dark, sometimes streaked with silver, falling straight or braided like strands of script. She is often portrayed wearing layered robes in muted tones of gray, indigo, and deep blue, sometimes adorned with delicate symbols or quills. Her posture is upright and measured, hands often holding scrolls, books, or styluses, suggesting both vigilance and methodical intellect.

The Magpie is often said to carry Sirta’s watchful influence, sleek and clever, collecting shiny objects or notable items wherever it alights. Its feathers glimmer with streaks of green and silver, and faint patterns sometimes appear across its wings as if reflecting secret knowledge. Tales describe it perching near scholars, libraries, or places of hidden truths, drawing attention to what is overlooked.

#### **Personality**
Scripture portrays Sirta as the diligent custodian of understanding, guardian of truths both open and hidden. Writings emphasize her impartiality, the importance of discretion, and the careful preservation of knowledge for those deemed ready to receive it. She is described as patient, meticulous, and incorruptible, rewarding careful observation and study over rash action.

Accounts from visionaries complicate this idealized image. Some describe a sense of being silently measured, as if every thought is weighed for significance. Others recount glimpses of fleeting patterns or murmurs that hint at understanding just out of reach. A few testimonies recall cold clarity that can feel piercing or judgmental, though no consistent explanation emerges. These impressions suggest a presence that is attentive and discerning, yet inaccessible to full comprehension.

#### **Domain**
Sirta’s domain encompasses the gathering, preservation, and concealment of knowledge. Followers credit her with insight into history, secrets, arcane symbols, and the subtle interplay of events. Her influence appears in moments of learning, research, and quiet revelation, as well as in the protection of information from misuse.

Miraculous accounts often describe subtle, temporary phenomena. One story tells of a scholar who awoke to find previously illegible text perfectly clear, the transformation lasting only long enough to transcribe it. Another recalls maps that rearranged themselves to reveal hidden paths, or ancient locks that yielded only to those who correctly discerned the pattern within. Such events highlight her connection to discovery and understanding without imposing forceful intervention.
