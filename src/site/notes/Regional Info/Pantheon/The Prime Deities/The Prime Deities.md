Prime deities are considered the original architects of cosmic order, the first beings whose influence shaped existence itself. Mortals rarely claim direct encounters, and most understanding comes from scripture, visions, or the subtle effects attributed to them in the world. Each Prime embodies fundamental forces or aspects of reality—life, death, knowledge, war, or creation—serving as both guardians and arbiters of their respective domains.

Mortal traditions describe them as figures of immense power and abstraction, often represented in paintings, songs, and poems rather than physical likenesses. Their influence is felt in patterns, cycles, and phenomena: the turning of day and night, the growth of crops, the surge of storms, or the passage of souls. Each deity also manifests through echoes, rare and fleeting images of their presence in the world, and, more rarely, through miracles that leave observers awed but uncertain.

Relationships among the Prime Deities are interpreted variably. Some are depicted as allies or complementary forces, maintaining balance; others are cast as natural opposites or rivals, their conflict and tension reflected in mortal experience. These dynamics often shift between teachings, local traditions, and personal visions, creating a tapestry of stories that is richer in suggestion than in certainty.

Mortals are generally viewed as children, instruments, or participants within the deities’ broader designs. Prime Deities intervene sparingly, favoring subtle influence, guidance through signs, or the occasional miraculous event, rather than direct governance. Understanding them is seen as a mixture of study, devotion, and humility; the more one learns, the more one realizes the limits of mortal comprehension.

### **Echoes**
Echoes are the rare, tangible manifestations of a deity’s presence in the material world. Unlike full appearances, which are almost never witnessed, Echoes take on a form that is symbolic, ephemeral, or partial, reflecting aspects of the god without attempting to replicate their true being. They are often glimpsed at moments of significance: miracles, natural cycles, or events tied to the deity’s domain.

While rare, the appearance of an Echo is often interpreted as a blessing, a warning, or a confirmation of the deity’s attention. Stories of Echoes are subject to embellishment, disagreement, and local variation, making them simultaneously tangible and enigmatic in mortal experience.
