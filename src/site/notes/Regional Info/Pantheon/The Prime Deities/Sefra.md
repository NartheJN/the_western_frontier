### **Goddess of Fate and Death**

---
#### **Description**
Sefra is imagined as a solemn, enigmatic figure. Stories describe her face as pale and angular, with shadowed eyes that seem to measure time itself. Hair is often dark and smooth, sometimes streaked with silver, flowing around her shoulders like the threads of a web. Artists depict her wearing long, hooded robes in shades of black, gray, and muted violet, patterned with subtle symbols of fate—spindles, threads, and weaving motifs. Her posture is calm and measured, almost statuesque, and her expression is one of quiet inevitability, evoking the impartiality and weight of destiny.

In lore, Moths are said to signify Sefra’s influence, gathering in swirling clouds that seem to move with deliberate, almost symbolic patterns. Their wings are semi-translucent, patterned like shifting constellations, and legends claim they appear at pivotal life moments—birth, death, or great change.

#### **Personality**
Scriptures portray Sefra as a quiet and exacting arbiter, shaped by unwavering purpose rather than feeling. Holy texts describe her as the embodiment of balance, carrying out endings with steady precision and overseeing fate with calm inevitability. In sermons she is spoken of as patient, impartial, and untouched by mortal fears.

Accounts from vision-bearers paint a less certain image. Some describe an overwhelming stillness that presses close, as though the world narrows to a single point. Others speak of a presence that feels attentive but distant, watching without revealing intent. A few claim she conveys a sense of gentle finality, while others insist there is a colder indifference behind her silence. No two recollections agree on the tone of her guidance, only on its clarity. These glimpses create a portrait shaped more by interpretation than truth, leaving mortals unsure where reverence ends and assumption begins.

#### **Domain**
Sefra’s influence governs fate, endings, and the passage between life and death. Her followers invoke her to ease transitions, understand the currents of destiny, or find guidance when change approaches. She is credited when difficult choices become clear, when grief softens unexpectedly, or when death comes with dignity and peace.

Miracles attributed to Sefra tend to be quiet and fleeting. One account describes a dying villager whose final moments were marked by a calm warmth, as if unseen hands smoothed fear and pain. Another tells of a traveler who, lost at a crossroads, was guided safely by fleeting glimpses of silvered moonlight, later interpreted as Sefra’s attention to the uncertain path. These events emphasize acceptance and balance, showing her influence as a subtle shaping of the world rather than direct interference.
