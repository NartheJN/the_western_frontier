### **Goddess of Moon and Tides**

---
#### **Description**
Suvanna is imagined as serene and flowing, her form humanoid yet infused with the softness of natural elements. Stories describe her skin as pale silver or moonlit gray, with subtle flecks like starlight. Eyes are crescent-shaped or reflective pools, conveying calm observation and quiet wisdom. Her hair is imagined cascading like river water or mist, often adorned with leaves, flowers, or glimmering threads resembling moonlight. Artists depict her wearing gowns of shifting greens, blues, and silvers, sometimes textured like bark, moss, or water. Her posture is graceful and fluid, evoking cycles of nature, balance, and subtle movement, often shown with one hand extended as if touching the growth around her.

Legends portray the Snow Leopard as the living emblem of Suvanna’s influence, sleek and silent, moving as if moonlight itself drifts along its spine. Its fur carries a silvered sheen, unusually bright under clouded skies, while eyes glimmer like polished moonstones. Tales suggest that plants along its path bend slightly, leaning toward it as if drawn by unseen forces.

#### Personality
Sacred texts portray Suvanna as the quiet keeper of cycles, a guiding presence who ensures that emotional currents and natural rhythms return to balance. Doctrine paints her as patient, attentive, and gentle in her stewardship, favoring restoration over correction. Clerics describe her as a source of calm deliberation, one who supports mortals through transitions without forcing outcomes.

Accounts from visionaries and dream-touched followers add nuance to this ideal. Some describe her presence as distant, producing an awareness of being watched without sensing intent. Others recall impressions of sudden closeness during moments of internal turning, as if she steps near only when change becomes unavoidable. A handful of testimonies speak of cool clarity that feels comforting to some and unsettling to others. These glimpses seldom agree, suggesting an influence that responds to shifting states rather than consistent personality.

#### Domain
Suvanna’s influence is understood to govern tides, both physical and metaphorical. Her name is invoked in matters of emotional equilibrium, dream-journeys, intuition, and the subtle forces that guide choices during times of transition. Followers credit her with steadying turbulent feelings, easing restless dreams, and revealing hidden patterns during pivotal decisions.

Tales of miracles attributed to her describe fleeting distortions in light and motion. One story recounts a shoreline where waves halted midsurge, the water forming smooth arcs as if caught between breaths. Another describes a sleeper whose shadow rippled gently despite the stillness of the room, followed by a sudden clarity of mind upon waking. Such accounts highlight brief moments where natural rhythms seem to pause or align, interpreted as signals of her attention rather than direct intervention.
