### **God of Storms and War**

---
#### **Description**
Gadeon is portrayed as tall, muscular, and imposing, a warrior-figure carved from storm clouds and shadow. His face is angular and sharp, with high cheekbones, a strong jaw, and storm-gray eyes that seem to crackle with energy. Hair is often shown whipping like blackened lightning or dark clouds, unbound and wild. He wears armor etched with jagged motifs or storm patterns, heavy yet elegantly crafted, and is frequently depicted wielding a massive weapon—a hammer, axe, or sword—with a stance ready for battle. Artists show him with broad shoulders and a posture of constant motion, capturing the tension and unpredictability of storms and combat.

The Gray Wolf often appears in stories as Gadeon’s fierce herald, large and tense with power. Streaks like lightning trace its fur, and its eyes gleam metallic silver. Witnesses in tales describe sparks sometimes leaping from its paws when it traverses stone or metal. It is imagined on hilltops or ridges as storms gather, its howl carrying like distant thunder.

#### **Personality**
Scriptures emphasize Gadeon as a motivator of courage, a divine force who urges mortals to confront danger rather than flee it. Texts describe him as unyielding yet purposeful, a figure who values resolve, discipline, and decisive action. Clergy often frame his teachings around controlled strength, arguing that he represents the will to endure conflict without succumbing to senseless destruction.

Visions reported by warriors and storm-touched devotees present a less orderly interpretation. Some describe a presence that feels impatient, pushing them toward choices they were not prepared to make. Others speak of a fierce pressure that seems to challenge rather than guide, leaving them unsure whether they were being tested or ignored. A few recount moments of unexpected calm in the midst of chaos, as though something stood beside them without intervening. These recollections offer no consistent picture of temperament—only the sense that his attention aligns with motion, risk, and turning points, though his intent remains unfathomable.

#### **Domain**
Gadeon’s influence is credited with shaping storms, conflict, adrenaline, and the fulcrums on which battles turn. His name is invoked by soldiers seeking clarity under pressure, sailors bracing for sudden winds, and leaders hoping for strength in decisions that carry cost. Followers believe he can harden resolve, stir momentum, or destabilize stagnation in moments where hesitation proves dangerous.

Stories of miracles attributed to him usually describe disruptions in weather or emotion. One tale recounts a skirmish where a deafening crack split the sky, though no lightning followed; the opposing force hesitated long enough for negotiations to resume. Another describes a warrior whose fear vanished in an instant, replaced by a sharp, cold focus that persisted until the danger passed. Such accounts typically involve abrupt changes in tension, treated less as blessings and more as brief realignments of circumstance.
